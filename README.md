✨ Key Features
Audio‑Driven Particle Mapping: Live environmental frequencies directly influence particle properties and adaptive states.

12D State Function Implementation: Extends 11D spacetime with a 12th dimension for internal adaptive state, enabling learning and memory.

Entropy & Replay Diagnostics: Real‑time entropy traces, conservation checks, and deterministic replay validation.

Dark Matter Integration: NFW density profile incorporated into gravitational dynamics.

Tokenization Pipeline: Continuous JSON token stream enriched with ψ breakdown metadata for reproducibility and blockchain‑ready export.

Modular Architecture: Additive design supporting Python, HTML/JS, and UI frameworks without breaking existing functionality.

🚀 Vision
This engine demonstrates how universal computation and intelligence may emerge from fundamental physics, offering both a research‑grade simulation tool and an interactive playground for exploring cosmological information dynamics.
